This is a simplistic discord bot that updates it's activity every 60 seconds to display 
a specific collections floor price. 
No need for an API key.

To make this work;
- Create a file in the same directory as this file called; ".env"
- Insert the line; "DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=YOURTOKENHERE"
- Save the file
- Do "npm i" in your terminal 
- Run the the bot either with; "npm start" or "node bot.js"
